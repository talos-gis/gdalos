# For applications involving visibility with radio waves,
# the refraction correction to be applied depends on the wavelength of the signal.
# The location of telecommunication sites is not merely a simple matter of determining the intervisibility
# but, rather, involves a number of parameters associated with the modeling of radio wave propagation
# including reflection, refraction specific to the frequency, attenuation (signal weakening),
# interference, atmospheric effects, and so on.
# Nonetheless, Observer Points and Viewshed are appropriate tools to use during the preliminary
# investigation stages of assessing possible telecommunication sites and coverage.

# atmospheric refraction coeff. 1/7 for visual, 0.325 for radio waves,
# in future we might calculate this based on the physics, for now we just fudge by the 1/7th approximation.

# refraction (float) â€“ The earth curvature correction option corrects for the curvature of the
# earth and refraction of visible light in air. Changes in air density curve the light downward causing
# an observer to see further and the earth to appear less curved. While the magnitude of this effect varies
# with atmospheric conditions, a standard rule of thumb is that refraction of visible light reduces the
# apparent curvature of the earth by one-seventh. By default, this model corrects for the curvature of the
# earth and sets the refractivity coefficient to 0.13.
